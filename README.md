# [Introduction](#1)
A couple of weeks ago, I wouldn't have even imagined that I could write my own password generator. As long as we dare to get out of our comfort zone, and face new challenges we'll thrive. Note that I used my own [library](https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_rps/tree/main/libft) for [printf](https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_password/blob/main/libft/ft_printf.c), [strlen](https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_password/blob/main/libft/ft_strlen.c) and [stncmp](https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_password/blob/main/libft/ft_strncmp.c).
