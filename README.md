# YOUR password, YOUR choice - a password generator with customization 

> ## “In the beginning, I looked around and could not find quite the car I dreamed of. So I decided to build it myself.” - Ferry Porsche

A couple of weeks ago, I wouldn't have even imagined that I could write my own password generator. As long as we dare to get out of our comfort zone, and face new challenges we'll thrive. Note that I used my own [library](https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_rps/tree/main/libft) for [printf](https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_password/blob/main/libft/ft_printf.c), [strlen](https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_password/blob/main/libft/ft_strlen.c) and [stncmp](https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_password/blob/main/libft/ft_strncmp.c).

1. `Git clone` the current repository.
      
       git clone https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_password.git
2. Go into the directory, and run the following command to `make` an archive, `compile` and `execute` `YOUR password, YOUR choice`.
      
       make -s
# Opportunities presented by YOUR password, YOUR choice
- You may easily adjust the maximal length of your generated password by modifying the global variable `MAX_LENGTH`in [password.h](https://github.com/lspohle/PRIVATE_password/blob/main/password.h).
- `YOUR password, YOUR choice` is easy to implement, and it should work on various operating systems (macOS and Ubuntu, for example). Keep in mind that you need `gcc` (a compiler for C) and `git` (an open source distributed version control system). They are pre-installed on macOS and Linux (not on Windows, for example).
